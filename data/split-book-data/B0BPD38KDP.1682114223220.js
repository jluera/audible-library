window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Harvard Business Review </i>called data science “the sexiest job of the 21st century,” so it's no surprise that data science jobs have grown up to 20 times in the last three years. With demand outpacing supply, companies are willing to pay top dollar for talented data professionals. However, to stand out in one of these positions, having foundational knowledge of interpreting data is essential. You can be a spreadsheet guru, but without the ability to turn raw data into valuable insights, the data will render useless. That leads us to data analytics and visualization, the ability to examine data sets, draw meaningful conclusions and trends, and present those findings to the decision-maker effectively.</p> <p>Mastering this skill will undoubtedly lead to better and faster business decisions. The three audiobooks in this series will cover the foundational knowledge of data analytics, data visualization, and presenting data, so you can master this essential skill in no time. This series includes:</p> <ul> <li>Everything data analytics: a beginner's guide to data literacy and understanding the processes that turns data into insights.</li> <li>Beginner's guide to data visualization: how to understand, design, and optimize over 40 different charts.</li> <li>How to win with your data visualizations: the five part guide for junior analysts to create effective data visualizations and engaging data stories.</li> </ul> <p>These three audiobooks cover an extensive amount of information, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Overview of the data collection, management, and storage processes.</li> <li>Fundamentals of cleaning data.</li> <li>Essential machine learning algorithms required for analysis such as regression, clustering, classification, and more....</li> <li>The fundamentals of data visualization.</li> <li>An in-depth view of over 40 plus charts and when to use them.</li> <li>A comprehensive data visualization design guide.</li> <li>Walkthrough on how to present data effectively.</li> </ul> <p>And so much more!</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
