window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>JRR Tolkien’s legacy of short stories which inhabit the realm of </b><b><i>The Hobbit</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>The Lord of the Rings</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Silmarillion</i></b><b>, on audio for the first time.</b></p> <p><i>Unfinished Tales</i> is a collection of narratives ranging in time from the Elder Days of Middle-earth to the end of the War of the Ring and provides those who have read <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> with a whole collection of background and new stories from the 20th century’s most acclaimed popular author.</p> <p>The book concentrates on the realm of Middle-earth and comprises such elements as Gandalf’s lively account of how it was that he came to send the Dwarves to the celebrated party at Bag-End, the emergence of the sea-god Ulmo before the eyes of Tuor on the coast of Beleriand and an exact description of the military organisation of the Riders of Rohan.</p> <p><i>Unfinished Tales</i> also contains the only story about the long ages of Numenor before its downfall and all that is known about such matters as the Five Wizards, the Palantiri and the legend of Amroth. The tales were collated and edited by JRR Tolkien’s son and literary heir, Christopher Tolkien, who provides a short commentary on each story, helping the listener to fill in the gaps and put each story into the context of the rest of his father’s writings.</p>";
