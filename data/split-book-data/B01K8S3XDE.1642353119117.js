But Gavin has no magic at all. Worse, in this prison Gavin may not be alone.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kip Guile will make a last desperate attempt to stop the White King's growing horde. Karris White attempts to knit together an empire falling apart, helped only by her murderous and possibly treasonous father-in-law, Andross Guile.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile Teia's new talents will find a darker use - and the cost might be too much to bear. Together they will fight to prevent a tainted empire from becoming something even worse.&nbsp;</p>";
