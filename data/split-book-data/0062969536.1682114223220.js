While the patched-up ship has seen better days, it offers her a bed, a chance to explore the far-off corners of the galaxy, and most importantly, some distance from her past. An introspective young woman who learned early to keep to herself, she’s never met anyone remotely like the ship’s diverse crew, including Sissix, the exotic reptilian pilot, chatty engineers Kizzy and Jenks, who keep the ship running, and Ashby, their noble captain.&nbsp;</p> <p>Life aboard the <i>Wayfarer</i> is chaotic and crazy - exactly what Rosemary wants. It’s also about to get extremely dangerous when the crew is offered the job of a lifetime.

In the far reaches of deep space, the tiny <i>Wayfarer</i> crew will confront a host of unexpected mishaps and thrilling adventures that force them to depend on each other. To survive, Rosemary’s got to learn how to rely on this assortment of oddballs - an experience that teaches her about love and trust and that having a family isn’t necessarily the worst thing in the universe.</p>";
