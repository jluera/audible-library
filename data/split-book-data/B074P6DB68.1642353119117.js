window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Narrated by Emmy Award–winning actor Martin Sheen, <i>The Home Front: Life in America During World War II</i> takes listeners <i>into</i> the lives of Americans at home—part of the Greatest Generation—who supported the war effort and sustained the country during wartime. The war brought immediate, life-changing shifts: the rationing of meat, dairy products, and sugar; an explosion of war-related jobs; and, despite mixed signals, a greater role for women working outside the home. Thanks to Martin Sheen’s performance and the voices of ordinary Americans throughout this Audible Original, listeners can feel what life was like during a disruptive and uncertain period of American history. Martha Little is the Executive Producer, and Dan Gediman is the series producer of <i>The Home Front.</i></p> <p><b>Note: </b><b><i>The Home Front</i></b><b> contains mature and sensitive themes.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
