But you know dogs - always getting into something. And when this dog gets into something that could launch an alien civil war, Wilson has to find a way to solve the conflict, fast, or be the one in the Colonial Union’s doghouse. </p> <p>\"The Dog King\" is a tale from John Scalzi's <i>The Human Division,</i> a series of self-contained but interrelated short stories set in the Old Man's War universe.</p>";
