Then something very bad happens to one of the Earthings, and with that, the relationship between humanity’s two factions is on the cusp of disruption once more. It’s a race to find out what really happened, and who is to blame. </p> <p>\"The Observers\" is a tale from John Scalzi's <i>The Human Division,</i> a series of self-contained but interrelated short stories set in the Old Man's War universe.</p>";
