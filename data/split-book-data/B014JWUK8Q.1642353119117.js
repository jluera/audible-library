window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The stunning conclusion to the trilogy that began with the Hugo, Nebula, and Arthur C. Clarke award-winning <i>Ancillary Justice</i>. </p> <p>For a moment things seemed to be under control for Breq, the soldier who used to be a warship. Then a search of Athoek Station's slums turns up someone who shouldn't exist, and a messenger from the mysterious Presger empire arrives, as does Breq's enemy, the divided and quite possibly insane Anaander Mianaai - ruler of an empire at war with itself. </p> <p>Breq refuses to flee with her ship and crew because that would leave the people of Athoek in terrible danger. The odds aren't good, but that's never stopped her before. </p> <p>In the Ancillary world: </p> <p>1. <i>Ancillary Justice</i> <br>2. <i>Ancillary Sword</i> <br>3. <i>Ancillary Mercy</i> </p>";
