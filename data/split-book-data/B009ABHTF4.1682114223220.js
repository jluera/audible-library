window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Two Towers</i> is the second volume of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. </p> <p>The Fellowship has been forced to split up. Frodo and Sam must continue alone towards Mount Doom, where the One Ring must be destroyed. Meanwhile, at Helm’s Deep and Isengard, the first great battles of the War of the Ring take shape. </p> <p>In this splendid, unabridged audio production of Tolkien’s great work, all the inhabitants of a magical universe - hobbits, elves, and wizards - spring to life.
