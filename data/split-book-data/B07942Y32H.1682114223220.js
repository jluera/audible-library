window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Epic fantasy writer and <i>New York Times</i> best seller Brandon Sanderson joined us in the Audible Studios to discuss <i>Oathbringer</i>, the third book in his Stormlight Archive, and he revealed his process for getting his books just right. Brandon also spoke about how others can sometimes discover that they're writing in the wrong genre and told us about the books he has unpublished. </p><p> Known for his thrilling imagination, immensely prolific writing and, of course, the creation of the Cosmere universe, in which all of his books are connected, Brandon Sanderson is a force to be reckoned with in the world of fantasy. With <i>Oathbringer</i> we get a return to a planet swept by apocalyptic storms and a world tipping into war as aristocratic families move to control ancient artefacts from a past civilisation that can win wars. </p>";
